# small_projects

Here is a collection of projects that are too small to be separate, but also have
the right to exist.

It's here now:
- `brainfuck`: interpreter of esoteric language Brainfuck along with its
    enhancements and translations
- `singlefile`: directory with single-file projects:
  - `lorem_generator`: a generator of lorem-like pseudotexts; an improved and
      extended version is in the project [lorem_text_bot](https://github.com/tetelevm/lorem_text_bot) 
  - `table_generator`: a little bicycle for formatted tables display
